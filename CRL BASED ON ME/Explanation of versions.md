Both versions are similar in their core logic and structure but differ in how they define the ErrorRanges and handle certain attributes in the Error type and subclasses. Here’s a breakdown of the differences and considerations for which might be better:

Key Differences

1. ErrorRanges Representation
	•	Version 1: Uses integer ranges (100..199) to define error categories.
	•	Version 2: Uses stringified ranges ("100..199") to define error categories.

Pros of Version 1:
	•	Easier to perform numerical comparisons using range-based logic (e.g., match on ranges directly).
	•	More concise and closer to how actual programming languages (e.g., Rust, Swift) handle range matching.

Pros of Version 2:
	•	More human-readable and explicit. Easier to maintain and modify without accidental range overlap.
	•	Fits better in environments where pattern matching on strings is more common (e.g., scripting languages).

2. Subclasses
	•	Version 1: Does not explicitly include range in the Error subclasses.
	•	Version 2: Explicitly assigns the range field (e.g., "RuntimeError", "LogicalError") to each subclass.

Pros of Version 1:
	•	Simpler subclass implementation without redundant or potentially mismatched data.

Pros of Version 2:
	•	Makes each error self-contained and explicitly tied to its error category. Useful in distributed or dynamic systems where you may not have central access to ErrorRanges.

3. Mutable Field
	•	Both versions handle the mutable field similarly. However:
	•	Version 1: Omits mutable in the NullReferenceError and DivisionByZeroError definitions (assumes false).
	•	Version 2: Explicitly defines mutable in all subclasses.

Pros of Version 2:
	•	Explicitly stating mutable improves readability and ensures all attributes are explicitly defined, reducing ambiguity.

4. Match Syntax
	•	Version 1: Uses direct range matching (ErrorRanges.SyntaxError => "Syntax Error").
	•	Version 2: Uses in to check membership (in ErrorRanges.SyntaxError).

Pros of Version 1:
	•	Simpler and leverages language-native range capabilities.

Pros of Version 2:
	•	Adds flexibility for future expansion if ranges are replaced by more complex patterns.

Which Version is Better?

For Performance-Oriented or Low-Level Applications:
	•	Version 1 is better due to its use of integer ranges for ErrorRanges, which aligns with efficient numeric comparison and pattern matching.

For Readability and Maintainability:
	•	Version 2 is better because it:
	•	Makes each error self-contained with explicit range assignments.
	•	Uses string ranges, which are more intuitive and adaptable in certain environments.

Suggested Improvements
	•	Combine the best of both worlds:
	1.	Use integer ranges for ErrorRanges for efficient comparisons.
	2.	Explicitly include range in subclasses for clarity and self-containment.

Example:

const ErrorRanges = {
    SyntaxError: 100..199,
    RuntimeError: 200..299,
    LogicalError: 300..399,
    CustomError: 400..499
};

class DivisionByZeroError: Error {
    exclusive = true;
    mutable = false;
    range = "LogicalError";
    message = "Attempted to divide by zero.";
    code = 300;
}

1.	Combined Integer Ranges:
	•	Retained the range as integers for efficient comparisons (100..199).
	•	Used in for checking membership during error categorization.
	2.	Explicit Range in Subclasses:
	•	Added the range field in each subclass for self-containment.
	•	Ensures that each error is clearly tied to its category.
	3.	Consistency in Subclasses:
	•	Included mutable in all subclasses, even when false, for clarity.
	•	Improved readability by maintaining consistent attribute definitions.
	4.	Optimized handleMutableError:
	•	Handles mutable errors dynamically by appending extra context to the error message.

This version balances performance with explicit readability, making it robust and easy to maintain.
